## About this Repository

If you're a recruiter or HR looking for a sample of my works, then you're at the right place because this repository is created specifically for you. This a public version of my personal project with the confidential information removed and may not be runnable as is.

## About this Project
I started this project by my own initiative when my boss told me to learn ReactJs. It is a very basic crud app built on ReactJs and .Net Core MVC. The .Net back-end is hosted in Azure so I can work on the React front-end on any computer without having to run the back-end on each machine.

Since the last time I've worked on this, I have been assigned on a real React project in the company. So please don't consider this project as a representation of my current web development skill.
